india,"Just got scammed for 45,000","Like the title suggests, I was dumb enough to get scammed for 45,000. I was trying to sell a treadmill on OLX, and once I put up the ad, I immediately got a few responses asking if it was available. after chatting a while with one buyer, we agreed on a given price of 45,000. 

When he said he would pay me immediately and then arrange for pickup, I got a bit suspicious, but I still trusted him, since his WhatsApp pfp and other credentials looked convincing. 

Then he sent me a PayTM split payment for 45,000, which I was supposed to send to him. So, I called him and asked about it. he said that because he is a merchant, he can't issue direct payments and can only initiate refunds. but I was still suspicious, so he sent me another split bill of 5000. I sent that, and he refunded that 5k to me, along with another 5k. 

So after that, he sent the 45k split bill request again, and stupidly, I agreed to send him the entire amount. After sending, he kept on shouting that for big amounts you have to do the payments twice and was asking for even more money. 

At this point, I realized I was getting scammed, so I cut the call, and went straight to the police station to file an FIR for cyber-crime. they told me to register a grievance on the Cyber Crime helpline 1930.

I am now at a 45,000 loss and in regret. But I can put that idiot on full blast here on Reddit. 

He contacted me on OLX with the name **Rajesh Kumar**. his phone number is **9162729406**. if any of you also get a call from him, report him immediately.

  
I know it was stupid of me to get scammed like this. But now I know better. ","Just got scammed for 45,000 Like the title suggests, I was dumb enough to get scammed for 45,000.

india,I found a MK bag on goa airport. You will be surprised knowing what was inside.,"I went to Goa few days ago with family and my return flight was on 3rd November from dabolim airport to Mumbai. I was quietly sitting in from of my boarding gate G in the evening when I found a black MK bag on the seat next to me..we were sitting there for 45 mins and no one was there. At first I thought someone will come but no one turned up. 
I told the indigo guys at the counter but they said to ask the security guys and raised their hand.
Now, any normal person would have just called security but I thought, it's airport,.the bag is already inside, there are very few chances of it having something bad in it. So I thought maybe I will find an id inside and contact the person.
So I opened it. Inside was just cash. 500ra notes. A bundle of it and some change and a lipstick. 😂 
Now at this point,  I cursed my parents for teaching me too much honesty. So I just closed the bag, went to the security and handed the bag to them. They submitted it to the security check at the conveyor belt there, counted the notes. It was over 50k+ and then they took my details and l left. 
I just hope that the person who thinks that only money and a lipstick is all she needs to conquer the world gets it back. 
Also, what would you have done guys in my situation? 🙈","I found a MK bag on goa airport. You will be surprised knowing what was inside.

india,"If you thought that the Government entrusting email services to one private corporation - Zoho - was bad enough, wait till you hear about Zscaler","Praveen Chakravarty (@pravchak) on X is [reporting](https://x.com/pravchak/status/1987061536125559261?s=20) that GoI staff has been asked to use Zscaler as an additional layer of security when accessing Zoho. There is a [document on scribd](https://www.scribd.com/document/763486781/1-zoho-mail-migration) that describes the steps that the user needs to follow. (Why an internal GoI process document is available in a public website like scribd is a topic for another day).

Think of Zscaler as a sort of VPN. And we can understand why this was needed: in the earlier system, when their mail was self-hosted on NIC servers, they had no need to use an additional security layer. Now that they have moved to a cloud-based solution, Zoho, they need to use one.

This opens an entire new can of worms. The Zscaler Client Connector, the component that runs on the user's computer, is capable of doing SSL/TLS decryption. This works by installing the Zscaler Root CA in the computer's trusted store. In plain English this means that the e-mails that are sent or received can be read *in plain text* by Zscaler. The Zscaler architecture needs this ability in order to perform its stated goal of securing the end-point, but the thought of an American corporation being privy to plain text GoI email traffic is something for us to consider. This should at least be discussed in parliament, if not released as a general Press Release for the citizens' information.

Now it is true that Zscaler is a globally trusted company, and their services are used by corporations worldwide. The question for us as Indian citizens, though, is if it is good enough to be used by the GoI in the National Security context. Zscaler is an American corporation: if for example the US government asks for a Lawful Intercept on GoI email traffic, they'll probably be bound to comply.

india,Why has India stopped debating?,"I grew up in India in 80s and 90s - a time when debate and discussion were part of our social DNA. 

From Doordarshan and Akashvani to later platforms like NDTV(then NDTV under Prannon Roy), and others, our media once celebrated discourse.

You could tune in and actually see people with opposing views engage respectfully, trying to reach some form of consensus.

Fast forward to today: that culture seems almost gone. India feels like a non-engaging, non-participatory democracy - where dialogue has been replaced by noise and questions are often seen as threats and shouting over your lungs gets you attention.

Debating used to be in the DNA of students, youth. Seems polarised views, opinionated attitudes and irrational beliefs killed such healthy debating culture?

Whether it was college canteens, newsrooms, or parliament - there was a culture of healthy disagreement and a search for consensus.

Debates are essential - they question conventional wisdom, promote transparency, and teach empathy. 

But now, disagreement is often seen as disloyalty.

What went wrong? Is it fear of backlash? The death of independent media?

Would love to hear from others - do you also feel India’s debating spirit has faded over the years?

india,Why is it almost impossible for a foreigner to get a sim card in India?,"Just landed in Mumbai and spent 3 hours trying to sort out a SIM card situation. This has to be one of the most tourist-unfriendly things I've encountered.

First off, barely any SIM card kiosks at the airport. Like, seriously? This is a major international airport and there's maybe one tiny shop that's sometimes open. Most other countries have multiple carriers competing right when you land. Here? Good luck even finding where to buy one.

Then when you finally find a place, they hit you with the requirements. They need a LOCAL ADDRESS (why local, why not my own from my ID). I literally just got off the plane. I'm standing at the airport. Where am I supposed to get a local address from? And apparently some places want a LOCAL PHONE NUMBER as a contact. How does that even make sense? I need a phone number to get a phone number?

The whole process is insane tons of paperwork, documents, verification steps. And THEN they tell you ""oh yeah it'll activate in 24 to 48 hours, maybe 72."" I'm only here for a week! What am I supposed to do for the first few days, just wander around with no way to contact anyone or use maps?

I've been to like 15 countries and never had this problem. Thailand? 5 minutes at 7-Eleven. Japan? Vending machine at the airport. Singapore? Multiple booths competing for your business the second you clear customs. India? Nah, let's make it as complicated as possible.

The weirdest part is India has over a billion phone users but somehow makes it nearly impossible for visitors to actually get connected. It's 2025 and I can't get basic phone service without jumping through hoops like I'm applying for a visa.

Anyone else dealt with this nightmare? Please tell me there's some workaround I'm missing.

( I know about E sims and International Roaming, I Just want to know whether there is better way of getting an Indian sim and my situation is a rare case)","Why is it almost impossible for a foreigner to get a sim card in India?

india,You can build your own air purifier for 2k,"TL;DR – Buy filters from IKEA, buy cabinet exhaust fans or use PC fans, make an enclosure from sunboard or cardboard. Caveats and test details below build.

  
[https://postimg.cc/gallery/5jMZjHQ](https://postimg.cc/gallery/5jMZjHQ)

  
Commercial air purifiers are expensive & bulky, with unnecessary features and costly/unreliable spares. Its quite easy to DIY one for much cheaper.

You will need - 

* Filters - I recommend 2x IKEA FÖRNUFTIG or UPPÅTVIND air filters, as they are incredibly cost effective and you can get replacements easily. These are EPA-12 filters, not H13 – but are perfectly adequate. They will take slightly longer to clean the room, but won’t stress the fans as much, and will live longer. For reference, H13 filters remove 99.95% of particles as small as 0.3 microns. EPA 12 filters remove 99.5%.
* Fans - I got a ""cabinet cooling fan system"" from amazon, since it comes with a power supply and a metal frontplate. But you can also use PC case fans.
* The structure - Cardboard or sunboard is easiest. I used some spare wood for the edges, but its not really necessary. Decent cardboard is sturdy enough.

  
Try to seal the sides and the bottom as best as possible. Use hot glue or tape.

You can also make a single filter or quad filter version, but IMO 2 filters are good enough and also don't take up as much space.

This idea isn’t new. Similar purifiers called CR boxes were popular during COVID. This design builds upon those. However, box fans are not as easily available in India, and neither are furnace filters. This is a cheap and space saving build with components easy to source in India (at home).

  
I also made an AQI monitor using a laser particulate matter sensor and an ESP32.   
I placed the sensor on the opposite side of the room and let it run for a bit, then closed my windows and turned the filter on. The sensor reads PM 1.0, PM 2.5 and PM 10. Readings before the filter was turned on were (35/50/62), and after 20 minutes fell to (17/24/27).

Some screenshots of the monitor log - [https://postimg.cc/gallery/jsjfTdk](https://postimg.cc/gallery/jsjfTdk)  
I would test with a commercial monitor but buying something 3x the cost of the purifier to check if it works doesn't sit right with me.

  
These filters have been running for about 2 months, if I give them a clean or get new ones the results would be better. Also, your results would depend on filter size, fan speed and room size (I ran mine in a room of \~120 sqft).



  
  
FAQs : In anticipation of r/India’s illustrious critics, I have taken the liberty of preparing answers to certain questions I expect.

a. Does it perform as well as a commercial purifier?   
I don't know, but it works and is cheap. If you are allergic to dust or have breathing problems, you would be better off buying a commercial one - knocking the box will make it shed some dust.

  
b. Does it reduce smells?  
No. You will still need to bathe.

  
c. How can you be certain your testing methodology is not flawed?  
I can't. I am a dummy. But I do see dust on the filter so I am pretty sure it works.

  
d. Why wouldn't you just buy one instead of putting in so much effort?  
Because I like to make complicated ramshackle solutions to simple problems.  


e. Why the IKEA filter?  Its not even HEPA-13??? Are you an IKEA shill? >:(  
Yes, yes I am. I love IKEA. They're not even paying me. I do it for free.

  
f. Can you recommend an easier and cheaper air purifier?  
Yes. Wear a mask. Or grow a bushy moustache and allow evolutionary design's own air purifier capture particulate matter before it can make it to your nose.","You can build your own air purifier for 2k TL;DR – Buy filters from IKEA, buy cabinet exhaust fans or use PC fans, make an enclosure from sunboard or cardboard.

india,Online medicine ordering in India: How do you ensure you're getting genuine products?,"Hey Reddit,



I've been a long-time user of MediBuddy and, for the most part, I've found it to be a reliable service. However, with the increasing number of online pharmacy apps like 1mg, PharmEasy, and Netmeds flooding the market, a few critical concerns have been weighing on my mind: specifically, the authenticity of medicines and the privacy of my personal health data.



The convenience of ordering prescription drugs online is undeniable, but it also opens up a Pandora's box of potential risks. How do you, as experienced users, navigate this landscape to ensure you're receiving genuine medications and that your sensitive information isn't compromised?



Here are some specific questions I have:

* **Verifying Authenticity:** What are your go-to methods for verifying the authenticity of medicines purchased through these apps? Do you scrutinize the packaging upon arrival, check for specific manufacturing details, or look for batch numbers that can be cross-referenced? Are there any online resources or databases you use to confirm a drug's legitimacy?
* **Licensing and Accreditation:** Do you actively look for licensing information or accreditations displayed by these online pharmacies? Are there any specific regulatory bodies or certifications (e.g., PCI DSS for data security) that give you more confidence in a platform?
* **Reviews and Reputation:** How much weight do you give to user reviews and the overall reputation of an online pharmacy? Are there particular platforms or forums where you trust reviews more than others?
* **Sticking to Brands/Pharmacies:** Do you tend to stick to certain well-known brands or established online pharmacies that you've had positive experiences with? Is brand loyalty a significant factor in your decision-making process?
* **Red Flags to Watch For:** What are the absolute ""red flags"" that would make you immediately cancel an order or avoid an online pharmacy altogether when purchasing prescription drugs? This could include unusually low prices, lack of clear contact information, requests for unusual payment methods, or suspicious-looking packaging.
* **Data Privacy Concerns:** Beyond medicine authenticity, how do you assess the data privacy practices of these apps? Do you read their privacy policies thoroughly, or are there specific indicators that tell you they prioritize user data security? Have any of you had negative experiences with data breaches or misuse of personal information from online pharmacies?

I'm genuinely looking for practical advice and insights from the community. Sharing your experiences and strategies would be incredibly helpful for me and, I'm sure, for many others who share these concerns.



Thanks in advance for your help!

Is this how we respect our Constitution? If people can't protest for something as fundamental as the right to breathe, then what are we left with? A flag without meaning.

india,What's the best way to find genuine deals during Flipkart and Amazon sales?,"As a meticulous consumer who constantly monitors price fluctuations, I've become increasingly aware that many ""discounts"" touted during major sales events can often be misleading. It's a common tactic for retailers to artificially inflate prices in the weeks or even days leading up to a sale, only to then present the original price as a ""discounted"" offer. This practice, often referred to as ""fake sales"" or ""phantom discounts,"" can make it incredibly difficult for consumers to discern genuine savings from deceptive marketing ploys.



To combat this, I've developed a robust strategy that primarily involves leveraging various browser extensions and dedicated price tracking websites. Tools like Keepa for Amazon, Honey, or similar historical price trackers, are invaluable in providing insights into an item's price history. These tools allow me to see how a product's price has changed over time, revealing any pre-sale price hikes and helping me identify whether a current ""deal"" is truly a good one or simply a return to the item's regular price.



However, despite these resources, I'm always eager to learn from the collective wisdom of fellow shoppers. I'm genuinely curious to understand what strategies and tactics have proven most effective for you. Do you have any favorite browser extensions, apps, or websites that you swear by for uncovering legitimate deals? Are there specific timing tricks you've learned, such as certain days of the week or times of the year, when genuine discounts are more prevalent? Furthermore, have you noticed particular product categories where deals tend to be more authentic and less prone to price manipulation? For instance, are electronics more susceptible to fake discounts than, say, apparel or home goods?



Let's pool our knowledge and share our most effective shopping hacks and insights. By collaborating, we can empower ourselves to navigate the often-tricky landscape of retail sales and ensure that we're truly getting the best value for our money. What are your go-to methods for identifying real deals and avoiding the pitfalls of deceptive pricing strategies? Your experiences and recommendations would be incredibly valuable!

india,The Air We Breathe: Decoding the India Air Purifier Market,"Hey r/India,

​With the AQI hitting headline-grabbing (and lung-choking) numbers every year, the Air Purifier market in India is a topic that's no longer a niche luxury—it's fast becoming a necessity. But for first-time buyers and those looking to upgrade, it's a confusing space.

​Let's dive into the state of the market, the real drivers, and what Redditors are actually buying.

​📈 Market Pulse: Small but Fast-Growing

​The Indian air purifier market is currently small, mostly concentrated in the metros like Delhi-NCR and Mumbai. However, it's growing at an explosive pace, projected to expand at a CAGR of over 7% to 12% in the coming years.

​Current Reality: The market is still very under-penetrated (some estimates suggest less than 1% of Delhi homes own one).
​
The Spike: Sales surge drastically, sometimes seeing a 5X to 20X jump in polluted cities like Delhi-NCR during peak winter/smog months (October-November).
​
The Drivers:
​Worsening Air Quality: This is the single biggest factor. Toxic outdoor air forces people indoors, only to realize indoor air quality can be just as bad or worse.
​
Rising Health Awareness: Increased knowledge about the link between pollution and respiratory/cardiovascular issues is fueling demand.

​Smart Tech: Introduction of smart purifiers with real-time PM2.5 display, app control, and IoT integration is appealing to urban consumers.

india,Ola Electric says the LG tech leak story is total bakwaas — here’s my take,"So apparently, Ola Electric’s in the news again — this time for all the wrong reasons (or maybe not).

  
Some Korean outlet claimed they got their 4680 Bharat Cell tech by leaking pouch-cell secrets from LG Energy. Big accusation.

Now, Ola has called it “completely baseless” — basically saying: *bhai, that tech you’re talking about, we don’t even use it.*

  
Their cell’s a dry-electrode cylindrical one, not the pouch kind. And they also pointed out how “interesting” the timing is — just when they’re about to scale production, suddenly there’s a leak story floating around.

**Classic.**

# Here’s what I find interesting:

1. **IP drama always sells.** Whether it’s batteries or herbs, the moment you start doing something original, someone will either copy it or accuse you of copying.
2. **For India, this is bigger than Ola.** If their Bharat Cell is genuinely indigenous — that’s huge. But with big claims comes big scrutiny. “Make in India” sounds cool until global players feel the heat.
3. **The real fight isn’t tech — it’s credibility.** You can have all the patents in the world, but if people don’t trust *you*, those patents are just paperwork.

# My 2 paise as a founder:

I’m in a completely different industry (wellness, nutraceuticals), but I get the same heat sometimes.  
You say “evidence-based herbal formula” and suddenly half the world thinks you’re repackaging Ayurveda, the other half thinks you’re pretending to be a pharma brand.

Truth is — people don’t just buy your product; they buy your process, your intent, and your consistency.

And if Ola’s really built that cell from scratch, they should keep showing the proof — loud and clear. No drama, just data.

# My open questions:

* Do you think Indian brands get judged harsher the moment they start competing globally?
* Or are we still in that stage where we love a success story until it gets “too successful”?
* And on a side note — do you think we’re moving toward a phase where “credibility” is the new marketing?

Anyway, let’s see how this unfolds.  
Whether it’s EVs or energy drinks, I guess the lesson’s the same — build clean, document everything, and don’t get distracted by noise.

My dad used to drive me and my friends 15km just to meet a few other friends of mine, they never pressured me about my marks, always sent me on school trips whenever I asked, gave good amount of money when I used to go out with friends. My dad runs a business and mom is well educated but a house wife now.

Bow the real thing is my parents are INCREDIBLY casteist like full on casteist, we are shudras. My mom is always like you gotta make more friends in the ""community"". Dads makes generalized casteist comments, like those ""x community"" people are misers etc. It really icks me but idk what to say to them.

Also dad is highly mysogynistic and causally says stuff like society got doomed the day women stepped out. Women have to handle household issues so that men can earn properly.

So now the problem I want to say something about this hut dont want to hurt them because they are always sweet with me. But hearing these is making me feel anxious about what they'd do if I were decide to ICM or things which are generally opposed to their beliefs.

Also dad is highly mysogynistic and causally says stuff like society got doomed the day women stepped out. Women have to handle household issues so that men can earn properly.

So now the problem I want to say something about this hut dont want to hurt them because they are always sweet with me. But hearing these is making me feel anxious about what they'd do if I were decide to ICM or things which are generally opposed to their beliefs.

EDIT: For people asking I am a general (forward caste), check castes in andhrapradesh if you want more info"

india,Struggling to Earn as a Student in India,"Hey everyone, I’m a first-year physiotherapy student living in Kerala, India, currently studying in Bangalore. I just wanted to share something that’s been really heavy on my mind lately. It’s so damn hard to earn money as a student here. Not just because I’m studying a tough course like physiotherapy, but because in India, there just aren’t enough opportunities for students to make a decent income.

Like, I see students in other countries  even school kids earning 20 dollars just by cleaning a garden or watering some plants. That’s like 1,600 rupees here. With that money, I could literally buy clothes, eat out, or save a bit. But here, if you want to earn, you’ve got to work 8 to 12 hours a day just to get 400 or 500 rupees. It’s honestly depressing.

I come from a middle class family, and I really don’t want to keep asking my parents for money every time I need something. I’m almost 19 now, and I want to take care of my own expenses, buy things I like, eat what I want, and just live freely without feeling guilty. But balancing college and work in India feels impossible. I’ve thought about learning video editing, coding, or other skills, but those take months to learn  and with my medical schedule, it’s just not realistic right now.

I’m just hoping someone out there can share some underrated, realistic ways to earn a bit something that doesn’t need years of learning. Maybe online or offline, just anything that can help a student like me survive without burning out. Any advice or even small ideas would mean a lot. 🙏","Struggling to Earn as a Student in India Hey everyone, I’m a first-year physiotherapy student living in Kerala, India, currently studying in Bangalore.

india,India Can Be Fixed,"I believe that India can only be improved through strict law and strong governance. There must be one rule for everyone, without any VIP culture, privilege, or exceptions. Politicians should not receive any special treatment. Every individual in this country should be equal before the law.

There must be a young, disciplined, and well-trained police force. Even they should face punishment if they make mistakes, behave badly, or take bribes. Police officers must remain calm and respectful. People must follow the rules, and every citizen should have the same and equal rights.

I am sorry, but there must be a strict law to punish serious criminals, even with death if necessary. Someone has to fix India once and for all. There should be no mob lynching, no road rage deaths, no killings in arguments. People must learn to respect one another and care for each other’s safety.

Government paperwork must be simplified. Ease of doing business must be improved. Children should be taught how to respect others, sex education, and how to behave properly with the opposite gender. It is our responsibility to create a calm and safe society for our families and loved ones.

Every sister, every mother should feel safe while going outside, without being judged or stared at. There should be a law where, if even one person notices someone behaving inappropriately with a woman or seeking the opportunity to do so, that man should be detained and taught a strict lesson. Everyone must have the right to complain anonymously without fear of consequences.

If I ever get the power, I will not let anyone take advantage of another person’s weakness. Everybody will have the same rights. I would be a strict leader who takes serious steps to clean India. I will employ honest, strong, and kind-hearted police officers. These men and women must protect civilians at any cost, and if they break the rules, the people can complain anonymously. If any officer tries to retaliate or take revenge, they must be punished until they learn their lesson.

There should be no VIP politicians; only normal people serving society. Government officials must have the same rights and treatment as everyone else. Either they work for the public properly, or they resign. Tax funds must be used efficiently for local people’s benefit.

Education must be free and equal for everyone. Rich and poor should study in the same schools and colleges. Education, healthcare, and law must be standard and uniform for all. Corrupt individuals should be strictly punished. Streets must be safe, with surveillance cameras everywhere.

If I have the power, I will take power away from corrupt politicians and give it back to normal citizens. Children from Class 5 onwards should be taught real-life skills, how to work, and how to earn money. By the age of 15, they should be capable of supporting themselves. Education must focus on science and technology.

I want to build a society where people can express themselves freely. People must be calm, responsible, and respectful. To change a generation, we need just 20 years of consistent discipline and teaching. There should be no encouragement of unnecessary freebies. Instead, people will be supported until they learn skills and become financially independent.

Population should be controlled. There should be a compulsory two-child policy. After the second child, birth control procedures should be mandatory in hospitals to prevent overpopulation. With a moderate population, there will be no shortage of resources.

I want to create a wonderful India. There should be volunteers for public safety in every street, available whenever needed. I will protect people and ensure equality with better civic sense.

Every profession should be respected equally — whether someone is a cleaner, a plumber, an electrician, or an engineer — all deserve the same respect. This cannot be achieved in a single day, but with efficient tax management, strong law enforcement, and education, we can create a generation that understands discipline, respect, and responsibility.

india,Physically felt pollution when entering Delhi," (Nov 09, 2025) Monday early morning I was coming from Ambala where I had gone for a couple of days. 

I can say that I have literally physically felt the effect of pollution while entering Delhi (entered from Singhu Border Side). Most people living in Delhi don't feel ""The Punch"" as they are accustomed to it.

On nearing the Bhalswa Garbage Mountain - yes it's very much there and has grown huge - I suddenly felt the strong unmistakable smell of burning (garbage/pollution?) - yes the massive garbage dump keeps on burning at many places!

After that all the real effects on the body started; 

1. Burning sensation in the eyes to the point that water came out and I couldn't keep them open- obvious driving hazard. I had to use a wet handkerchief and wipe the eyes - to little effect

2. Burning sensation in the throat and tip of the tongue. The body created mucus to conteract the foreign particles entering inside. I immediately felt that I had a throat infection or sore throat .

3. Thoughts became cloudy and less clearer

Possible reasons: 

On the way along the road itself, I could see a number of places where stubble/ parali is being burnt openly and blatantly in the fields by the farmers. 

In addition, there were a number of places along the road with random fires that were spewing toxic black smoke in the air including in residential areas - there was a massive fire in Rohini yesterday. 

Many factories/brick kilns work unhindered during the night- emitting thick smoke into the air

Guys, pollution is  very real and serious here. It is really impacting the body physically in unknown ways. Nobody knows what impact the particulate matter particles PM10, 2.5 (and smaller) have on the body in long term or short term. 

You cannot ignore the pollution or wish it away. 

My advise is, if you can, ditch Delhi NCR altogether- there's nothing more important than your health. Even if you earn less, try to relocate to a healthier place. 

Try to be away from here as much as possible - even places like Ambala feel better in comparison. 

Use the best and biggest air purifiers that you can afford and use them day and night in home, in car in office- everywhere.","Physically felt pollution when entering Delhi  (Nov 09, 2025) Monday early morning I was coming from Ambala where I had gone for a couple of days.

india,"My ""Honest"" review on Rss schools","This is my honest experience of spending approx 10 yrs in RSS school .

I've studied in RSS school since my 1st class. Honestly I used to hate it in initial years but as i grew up i started to understand the things more neatly. 
So starting of the day we used to Sing National Anthem, Rss""Prarthna""(prayer) and pledge in my regional language, then students from alloted class for that day used to present thoughts/stories. 
If its someones birth/death aniversary , info about them etc . We used to celebrate even small Festivals together , like intrested girls/boys used to perform  various kind of activities like drawing rangoli , singing devotional songs etc . Teachers used to tell importance of that festival .
Apart from that we used to have project presentations/competitions on such days.
About Academics , i didn't realised then but when i look back I can say it was different 
e.g. History , the Teachers more focused on ""Hindus""/""Indians"" if we compare it to other boards. 
We also had Daily Yoga and exercise sessions after prayer. 
One thing is definitely true that Rss schools are next level Decipline oriented!! From waking up at 5 am, saying prayer before eating even at home , Keeping your place clean To sleeping on exact time daily ,I am still used to it all.
As a girl , monthly We used to get Free Sanitary napkins. 
Sometimes They also used to conduct special Sessions for girls by gynecologistsand Also to aware them about things like Love jihad, and How muslims are rapidly increasing , their motive etc 
We also learnt karate , other self-defense techniques, and Stick training.
About sports , we had numerous things even they used to encourage students to participate in district/state level competitions 

The only thing i think these schools or atleast my school lacked is adaption to Technology. 

This was my overall experience , it's not any propaganda post it's up to you to decide whether it's Good or bad . 
If you ask mine , Now I feel it was Really good ! The Kind of decipline, Mindset I have now compared to my peers is something discernable .

india,"We need to talk about Indian men to whom ""liberal"" just means alcohol, non veg, and sex","India is a conservative society, and I'm a man myself who has also felt repressed by it, though my own parents are somewhat liberal. And I meet many fellow Indians, both in major cities and abroad, who complain how backward our society is.

And I feel them. But to many of the men I meet who have these complaints, shedding the conservative mindset is largely about shedding the taboos around premarital sex, drinking alcohol, eating meat, and partying. When it comes to misogyny, you'll see little difference between them and a village patriarch. You can expect the same gross sexist comments and outlooks on women. They'll be grossed out by gay people and are still overly concerned about displaying their masculinity. Many haven't let go of casteist attitudes and slurs, and will readily say racist things about Africans and east Asians. 

Basically, when they complain about their family being conservative/traditional, it's entirely about how indulging in pleasures is frowned upon – about how things that you can enjoy are restricted, not about how they view women and people different from them. 

Now I personally drink alcohol occasionally (not a big fan usually) and have lived with a partner without marrying her. I don't eat meat for ethical reasons but don't hold any religious prejudice against it (I'm not religious). But these are not the hallmarks of my progressivism. That to me is about how I treat and see women, people of other races/ethnicities, the LGBTQ community, oppressed castes, etc. People need to understand that indulging in pleasures does not mean they're not traditional or conservative.","We need to talk about Indian men to whom ""liberal"" just means alcohol, non veg, and sex India is a conservative society, and I'm a man myself who has also felt repressed by it, though my own parents are somewhat liberal.

india,National Consumer Helpline works! and Swiggy sucks. Bye.,"Ordered something from Instamart last month, but it never got delivered - nothing unusual there. I complained to Swiggy, and they asked for ""pictures of undelivered item"" - again, totally normal. I reached out to them through call and email - this is where it got unusual - ""Couldn't validate your claim. Can't refund."" Huh?! Can't refund 1600rs? Can't deliver the item also? This feels like stealing in broad daylight!

Since 1600rs is not a very small amount for me, I went full crazy with calls and emails only to get the same robotic reply each time. In a fit of rage, I filed a complaint on the National Consumer Helpline (honestly, didn't think it would help) and parallely kept spamming swiggy's inbox purely for emotional satisfaction. Obviously, I received the same scripted responses until they finally ghosted me. My plan was to keep spamming them just for fun, but I eventually gave up and moved on with my life.

Then today - boom! I got a message saying my refund was processed! Even got an email that said, ""We're looking into your consumer complaint, but first, here's your money."" Excuse me, WHAT?

While I'm relieved to have my money back, it's also infuriating. What if I hadn't filed the complaint? How much money do these people make on a daily basis just by scamming people?

india,I’ve been fighting for 16+ months to reclaim my own ancestral land that was illegally encroached by 15–20 people at 3 AM. I’m exhausted and i don’t know how to cope,"I never imagined I’d be in this situation.
My family has owned our land for over 50 years it’s ancestral, worth multiple mils 

But on 3 June 2024, around 3 AM, a group of 15–20 people, broke into my property.
They tore down the boundary wall, threw out my watchman, looted cash, and took full control of my land.

Over the next few months, they built 20+ illegal shops inside my boundary and started dividing the land into plots as if it was theirs.
I’ve been watching my own property being stolen in slow motion, while the system just looks away.

The emotional and financial toll is exhausting.

I’m sharing this because I genuinely feel unheard.
Every system that’s supposed to protect us has failed.
If anyone reading this has gone through something similar or knows how to make authorities act please tell me.

I’m not giving up this land is my family’s legacy.
But it’s heartbreaking how blatant injustice can continue in broad daylight, while someone like me has to fight endlessly just to be heard.

A few days ago, I even shared everything on X (Twitter) documents, photos, maps, and case details hoping that public attention might finally make authorities act.

I swear 2 normal reels later and I’m getting accounts hating on different minorities especially towards Indians from other minorities smh. Honestly even going online and seeing hate is just upsetting af. Doesn’t matter how less I use social media, somehow or the other it’ll show.

Do I understand some of it? Yeah absolutely, a lot of us really have zero civic sense. But damn we’re all splitting due to language and religion and caste, I swear shit seemed better years ago.

There’s way more issues, idk what to do, I’d probably stay in India in the future but most jobs pay shit and people abroad hate us even as tourists due to some people ruining everything. This level of hate won’t last forever but still.

Seriously what do we even have to do to change? I love a lot about our country like our festivals, cultures, food and all, but the annoyance and disappointment is more. I just want us to develop man.

Edit: Im very much and was aware that this is gonna be one hell of a controversial post but I said what I had to say. If someone calls me anti national after reading all this, you've gotta consider a career in comedy.","Fucking terrible year to be Indian Terrible civic sense, corrupt politicians, idiots abroad ruining shit, racists attacking people online and offline calling us smelly and gross, India and Pakistan fights as if other ppl wouldn’t think they’re the same, the government, the lack of safety for women, casteism, religious conflicts and the way there seems to be nothing we can do.

I swear 2 normal reels later and I’m getting accounts hating on different minorities especially towards Indians from other minorities smh. Honestly even going online and seeing hate is just upsetting af. Doesn’t matter how less I use social media, somehow or the other it’ll show.

india,"Paid ₹349 for Jio Porting, But Had to Pay Again After UPC Code Delay — Is This Fair?","Hey everyone,
I recently faced a really frustrating issue while trying to port my BSNL number to Jio, and I want to know if anyone else has gone through the same thing.

On 20 October 2025, I started the MNP process on Jio’s official website. The site asked me to enter my mobile number and PIN code, verified my OTP, and then asked for a ₹349 recharge before entering the UPC code (which is normal on Jio’s portal).

So I recharged ₹349 (Transaction ID: 551020072050334) at 7:11 AM, but that day BSNL’s UPC code couldn’t be generated — their system wasn’t responding.
Because of that, I had to stop the process there.

Now, a few days later, when the UPC code finally got generated, I went back to the Jio website to complete the port. But the system again asked for another ₹349 recharge — as if my earlier payment never existed! 😤

I contacted Jio Customer Care, but they simply said, “You’ll have to recharge again.”
That means paying twice for the same MNP request — one failed due to no fault of mine, and another for the new UPC.

Is this even legal or fair?
TRAI’s rules clearly say that if porting fails due to a system issue, the customer’s prepaid amount should be refunded or adjusted — not wasted.

I’ve already mailed Jio and plan to file a complaint on pgportal.gov.in, but I wanted to hear your thoughts too.
Has anyone else faced this problem? Did you get your refund or any response from @JioCare?




TL;DR

Recharged ₹349 for Jio MNP before UPC code generation (20 Oct 2025).

BSNL UPC didn’t generate that day → port process incomplete.

Now Jio asking again for ₹349.

First payment unlinked and no refund so far.

Planning to escalate to TRAI.




What do you guys think — should customers be made to pay again in such cases?
Or should Jio fix their system to link previous recharges with new UPC codes?

india,horrors that happen to people in mumbai local and people move on easy,"few days ago as i was waiting for my ac train at dadar, i witnessed 100s of people risking everything just to catch that 1 train they catch everyday, to avoid reaching home late so that they can finally be at peace after the misery of a long working day, which also begins with a game of thrones(same spot), people trying to catch their thrones in the same train everyday.

coming to what i saw, today, within a span of 30 seconds i saw 2 lives completely disoriented and disturbed in an attempt to catch a train.

i had been standing for over 10 mins at the same spot, first in the queue of ac train, right before my train arrived, was 1 virar train, same story, 100s of people approximately calculating the speed of the arriving train and their plan of action to carry out a perfectly calculated move to catch the train in hopes having the chance to get inside without being thrown, dragged, and pushed across once the train stops.

right as i started to think that the chaos is gonna settle, i saw a man apprach towards me from the left, confused, overstimulated, and stressed, mind you i was listening to music (Adrenaline - hardboneboy, kick ass dhh), the man looked at me pointing towards my right, i thought he was asking if ac's door is gonna be right where i am standing so i said yes (without pausing my music) and pointed in front of me showing that yes doors gonna be here, 2 seconds later he suddenly comes in front of me, bends over and picks up a pair of prescribed glasses, which was very close to a persons feet who was frantically trying to push his way through the crowd into the virar train that was haulted.

right as he picked up, his glasses, i realised that he was in an attempt to catch the train, but one miscalculated move, either from him or someone around him might have knocked off his specs off his face and thats what he was confused and stressed about in the moment, just as I realised what just unfolded in front of me, i paused my music to get a grasp of the situation. btw his glassed got heavily scratched, unusable.

regardless, he looked at it for a second, put it back on and continued his struggle to catch the damn train, which he successfully got on finally, all that struggle earned him like 15 mins of reaching home early, costing him no less than a 2000rs of damage repair for his specs, if he were to try catching the next train after, that too assuming he pulls off getting on the next train, it means nothing but restarting the same level right again.

the train finally moves, carrying 100s of lives that just got risked trying to get on it. right as i thought the chaos of this one virar is settled, i look to my right and saw a girl, not older than 13 years of age, again, confused, visibly stressed, and disoriented, frantically screaming for his mom, ""mummy, mummy"" that got lost in the wave of crowd and chaos.

turns out her mom got dragged away into the train with the crowd, and who got lost was the little girl, separated from the very human she trusts the most, on the verge of crying she immediately goes to an onlooking uncle and grabs the phone from his hand (rightfully so), the uncle with no objections whatsoever to help the little girl out told the girl to call her mom immediately, while getting surrounded with a bunch of people who withnessed her, all ready to help her out.

i observed the crowd helping that kid for another 2 mins after which my train arrived, where i got ready to fight for a safe spot for my ownself so as to reach home timely and safe, which i lowkey insured by just overspending 46% of 1 months stipend for a 3 month pass just so i could make sure i reach home safe with my belongings everyday.

all this was witnessed by me in a span of 3 mins... the horrors that aren't questioned, and if questioned, go unanswered, people move on, not even slightly concerned with things that directly afftect their quality of life, thinking what even can i do questioning legitimacy of the accountable dignitaries, further feuling their nonchalance towards actual welfare, while actively reacting to things that are not even remotely concerned with improving their quality of life. this is the city of dreams for you.","horrors that happen to people in mumbai local and people move on easy few days ago as i was waiting for my ac train at dadar, i witnessed 100s of people risking everything just to catch that 1 train they catch everyday, to avoid reaching home late so that they can finally be at peace after the misery of a long working day, which also begins with a game of thrones(same spot), people trying to catch their thrones in the same train everyday.

india,[DELHI] This is a call for help. A friend's mother needs support.,"This post is on behalf of my friend's mother. She is in dire need of financial aid/support/resources to organizations/people that can provide genuine help. All context has been stated below, and my DMs are open for anything, everything. 

I believe this will be a long one, and I know I'll have to touch upon a bunch of sensitive topics, hence the NSFW tag. Using fake names for privacy reasons, but all information shared has been green flagged by the people I'm here on behalf of. 

**Some history**

My friend, we'll call Kim (21F) comes from a troubled family. Kim has a sister, Sam (28-30F). The mother is in her early 50s. The father is a terrible, horrible, vile person that I hope no one has to be subjected to, ever. He's physically, financially, sexually and emotionally abusive, has a vast history of substance abuse, gambling.

He'd refuse to get groceries for the family and starve them just to assert dominance, torture and abuse the mother, Sam and Kim immensely just for ""fun"", just because he could. They're originally from Lucknow, they moved to Delhi a couple years ago because Kim got into DU. The father never had a proper job, but he used to resort to illegal gambling and trading of illegal goods here and there to feed his vices, while neglecting the family.

Kim is in DU, pursuing her Bachelors. Sam, due to familial issues, grew into an inconsistent, unpredictable person that hops between jobs and struggles to provide any consistency to her family, or herself. 

To feed the family and try and make things better, the mother tried to, and ran multiple ventures like food stalls, beauty parlors. All of these ventures were shut down by the father because ""how dare someone feed my family other than me"". 

They also have an adopted indie, who's a GEM! 

**Current Situation**

All of Kim's mother's savings are depleted. Sam has started a new job, first month, but it's dicey if she'll contribute to the overall familial situation. She has consistent history of being a little absent, even when she's had the resources to provide. Kim is in college, no job/internship yet, but within 6 months, her Bachelors will end and she'll hopefully pick up any job. The father, responsible for paying the rent, apparently didn't pay the rent for 4 months. They need to evict. 

Financially, things are really, really tight. There's no solid source of income, unless you count in Sam. Things are very tense.

**What They Need**

The mother is actively looking for a new apartment to move to. Her budget is within 10k. She's also, actively looking for a job. She has a lot of cooking experience, especially with stalls. She's open to all options. Either: 

\- direct financial aid  
\- real estate suggestions  
\- job opportunities  
\- org/ngo recommendations  
\- anything else that can be helpful in any way shape or form.

Please reach out to me if anyone has anything. We're desperate.
